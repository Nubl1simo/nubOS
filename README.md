This is a little project I am doing as a hobby, this will be a bootstrapping script for Arch Linux and maybe a version for Artix Linux will be released, if it's not compatible.
For now it's a post-installation script that installs Xorg, bspwm, and configures it with my config files.
edit: lmao i'm on void linux now, this means that development will continue in a slower manner
